  Linear Regression Analysis using Big Query (Google Cloud Platform)

'''




'''

  This is a program that uses linear resgression to predict how many Wins (W) a team will have

  based off of how many Wins (W) the team already has. For this example, the Lahman Baseball Database

  was used. The training set of this data included data between 1950 and 1999. The testing set

  included data from 2000 to present.

#Create a linear regression model (teamWins will be name of the model).

CREATE MODEL Lahman.teamWins

OPTIONS(model_type="linear_reg") AS

SELECT W AS label,HR

FROM Lahman.Teams

WHERE yearID >= 1950 AND yearID <= 1999




#Find the weights (coefficients) for the linear regression model.

SELECT *

FROM ML.WEIGHTS(MODEL Lahman.teamWins)




#Predict how many Wins a tean will have. Off by about 9 games(mean_absolute_error).

SELECT *

FROM ML.EVALUATE(MODEL Lahman.teamWins,(

SELECT W AS label,HR

FROM Lahman.Teams

WHERE yearID > 1999
